% Additional things to be done
% - use non-zero gain increment for occupied voxels to avoid
% moving away from the object
% - going back to previous pose if failing to build tree from current pose
% - add comments inside functions
% - organize in classes
% - own implementation of kd-tree allowing dynamic point addition to an
% exsiting kd-tree
% - include UAV dynamics in path planning, i.e.: when executing the first
% edge of the best branch
% - Simulink implementation
% - interfacing with ROS
% - use of RRT*
% - stereo camera simulation implementing stereo matching
